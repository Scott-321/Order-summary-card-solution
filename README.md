## My process

Before I started coding, I studied the Read me file and the design images. As the design needed to be responsive, I decided to use Flexbox to lay out the elements. This along with media queries, allowed me to reposition the flex-items, from column to row, to accommodate wider screen sizes. 

I used a Mobile-first workflow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed practicing with max-width and min-width media queries.

### Continued development

Flexbox tends to be my go-to layout tool for these small projects. This is because I learnt flexbox before Grid. As the challenges get harder and the layouts get 2 dimensional, I am looking forward to introducing grid into my workflow.  

I am really interested in making my CSS less repetitive, and easier to read/maintain. Recently, I have been reading about the BEM naming convention, which I will be incorporating in my future projects.
